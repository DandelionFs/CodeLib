### have a ball

Ball除了“球”之外还有“舞会”的意思。能参加舞会自然意味着可以尽情的吃喝玩乐咯~。随着时间的推移，have a ball的意思也就逐渐引申出了have a good time的意思。 

“尽情狂欢，玩得嗨，过得愉快”


#### the ball is in your court
if the ball is in someone’s court, they have to do sth before any progress can be made in a situation看到英文的惯用语，通常不能照字面上来翻译。这一句The ball is in your court字面意思：球在你的场内。当你得到球时，你就掌握了决定权，所以当别人和你说这句话时，代表他们在等你的决定，或是他们对你的想法不打算表达意见。“轮到某人作出反应（或采取行动）”

- Well, that's what I know about it. Now the ball is in your court.好，我对此事知道的就这些了，现在该你讲了。

#### on the ball

这里可不要理解为“在球上”棒球是美国最流行的体育项目，所以有多来自棒球的常用语也不足为奇。据说在棒球运动中，高技术投手的球很难被接到，但如果机灵、反应迅速的话，就可以接到球啦~所以这个小短语表示“机灵，灵敏；工作能力强”
- Watch his bread, it seems to be delicious. He had a lot on the ball.看他烤出来的面包，看上去很好吃，他真能干。

#### not on the ball
加了否定词not，也就是“反应迟钝，不在状态”的意思啦~

I didn’t sleep well last night and I’m not really on the ball today.我昨晚没有睡好，所以今天反应迟钝。


#### start the ball rolling
start可以替换为get/set/keep

to do sth which starts as an activity, or to start doing sth in order to encourage other people to do the same.着手干，开始做；带头做

- I decided to set the ball rolling and got up to dance.我决定带个头，就站了起来跳舞。
- Gentlemen, perhaps I should start the ball rolling.诸位先生，或许应该由我来开个头。

#### have the balls to do sth

- What happened? Who dropped the ball on this?怎么了？是谁搞砸了？
- I never drop the ball on any project or task.我从没有搞砸任何一项工作。


#### a ball of fire
充满活力和热情的人；生龙活虎的人；朝气蓬勃的人

### “唯命是从”

“enact his will without qualms and questions. ”这个表达的字面意思就是不带任何顾虑和质疑地将某人的意愿付诸行动。但是我们博大精深的汉语用四个字就可以表达得清清楚楚啦！当我们想表达“听XX使唤”；“任XX差遣”;"听命于XX“”等意思时，都可以用这个表达。那么关于“唯命是从”还有哪些表达呢？我们一起来学习一下吧！

- He is not her boyfriend. He is like her errand boy who enacts her will without qualms or questions. 他不像她的男朋友。而是像一个唯命是从的狗腿子。

#### Uncle Tom

这个表达源自哈丽雅特 · 比彻 · 斯托所著长篇小说《汤姆叔叔的小屋》中的人物。旧时有时用以指想讨好或侍奉白人的黑人男子。在某些语境下可以用来指代“逆来顺受，唯命是从”的人。贬义的语境下可以翻译成“狗腿子”。
- Don't take me as your Uncle Tom! I won't run errands for you!我可不是你的狗腿子，我不会为你跑腿儿。
