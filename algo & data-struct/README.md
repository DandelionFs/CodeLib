## ACM SoftwareProcesse

### SE/Software Processes（软件工程/软件过程）

#### Topics:（主题）

**[Core-Tier1]（必须掌握的核心知识：第 1 级）**
• Systems level considerations, i.e., the interaction of software with its intended environment (crossreference IAS/Secure Software Engineering)
• Introduction to software process models (e.g., waterfall, incremental, agile)
o Activities within software lifecycles
• Programming in the large vs. individual programming

**[Core-Tier2]（必须掌握的核心知识：第 2 级）**
• Evaluation of software process models

[Elective]（选修部分）
• Software quality concepts
• Process improvement
• Software process capability maturity models
• Software process measurements

#### Learning Outcomes:（学习成果）

**[Core-Tier1]**

1. Describe how software can interact with and participate in various systems including information management, embedded, process control, and communications systems.[Familiarity]

2. Describe the relative advantages and disadvantages among several major process models (e.g., waterfall, iterative, and agile). [Familiarity]

3. Describe the different practices that are key components of various process models. [Familiarity]

4. Differentiate among the phases of software development. [Familiarity]

5. Describe how programming in the large differs from individual efforts with respect to understanding a large code base, code reading, understanding builds, and understanding context of changes. [Familiarity]

**[Core-Tier2]**

6. Explain the concept of a software lifecycle and provide an example, illustrating its phases including the deliverables that are produced. [Familiarity]

7. Compare several common process models with respect to their value for development of particular classes of software systems taking into account issues such as requirement stability, size, and non-unctional characteristics. [Usage] 

**[Elective]**

8. Define software quality and describe the role of quality assurance activities in the software process.[Familiarity]

9. Describe the intent and fundamental similarities among process improvement approaches. [Familiarity]

10. Compare several process improvement models such as CMM, CMMI, CQI, Plan-Do-Check-Act, or ISO9000. [Assessment]

11. Assess a development effort and recommend potential changes by participating in process improvement (using a model such as PSP) or engaging in a project retrospective. [Usage]

12. Explain the role of process maturity models in process improvement. [Familiarity]

13. Describe several process metrics for assessing and controlling a project. [Familiarity]

14. Use project metrics to describe the current state of a project. [Usage]
