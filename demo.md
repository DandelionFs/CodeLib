## 字典 & json

通过键来引用值

## JSON

**Json**(**JavaScript Object Notation**) : 数据打包的格式, 本身没有统一的函数调用来控制；格式要求必須且只可以使用双引号作为Key或者值的边界符号, 不可以使用单引号，而“key”必須使用边界符，但字典不一样了[^1]。

```json
{
    "studentInfo":
    {
        "id": 123456,
        "Stu_Name": "Domo"
    }
}
```

> Data types and syntax
>
> JSON's basic data types are:
>
> - Number: a signed decimal number that may contain a fractional part and may use exponential [E notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_notation), but cannot include non-numbers such as [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN). The format makes no distinction between integer and floating-point. JavaScript uses a [double-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) for all its numeric values, but other languages implementing JSON may encode numbers differently.
> - [String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)): a sequence of zero or more [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) characters. Strings are delimited with double-quotation marks and support a backslash [escaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character) syntax.
> - [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_datatype): either of the values `true` or `false`
> - [Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure): an [ordered list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)) of zero or more values, each of which may be of any type. Arrays use [square bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_bracket) notation with comma-separated elements.
> - [Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)): a collection of [name–value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute–value_pair) where the names (also called keys) are strings. Objects are intended to represent [associative arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array),[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#cite_note-ecma2013-8) where each key is unique within an object. Objects are delimited with [curly brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braces_(punctuation)#Braces) and use commas to separate each pair, while within each pair the colon ':' character separates the key or name from its value.
> - `null`: an empty value, using the word `null`
>
> [Whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character) is allowed and ignored around or between syntactic elements (values and punctuation, but not within a string value). Four specific characters are considered whitespace for this purpose: [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)), [horizontal tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_tab), [line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed), and [carriage return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return). In particular, the [byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) must not be generated by a conforming implementation (though it may be accepted when parsing JSON). JSON does not provide syntax for [comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)).
>
> Early versions of JSON (such as specified by [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier)) [4627](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627)) required that a valid JSON text must consist of only an object or an array type, which could contain other types within them. This restriction was dropped in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier)) [7158](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7158), where a JSON text was redefined as any serialized value.

## Reduction_Complexity[^1] 归约

#### Example[^2]

> The following example shows how to use reduction from the halting problem to prove that a language is undecidable. Suppose *H*(*M*, *w*) is the problem of determining whether a given [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) *M* halts (by accepting or rejecting) on input string *w*. This language is known to be undecidable. Suppose *E*(*M*) is the problem of determining whether the language a given Turing machine *M* accepts is empty (in other words, whether *M* accepts any strings at all). We show that *E* is undecidable by a reduction from *H*.
>
> To obtain a contradiction, suppose *R* is a decider for *E*. We will use this to produce a decider *S* for *H* (which we know does not exist). Given input *M* and *w* (a Turing machine and some input string), define *S*(*M*, *w*) with the following behavior: *S* creates a Turing machine *N* that accepts only if the input string to *N* is *w* and *M* halts on input *w*, and does not halt otherwise. The decider *S* can now evaluate *R*(*N*) to check whether the language accepted by *N* is empty. If *R* accepts *N*, then the language accepted by *N* is empty, so in particular *M* does not halt on input *w*, so *S* can reject. If *R* rejects *N*, then the language accepted by *N* is nonempty, so *M* does halt on input *w*, so *S* can accept. Thus, if we had a decider *R* for *E*, we would be able to produce a decider *S* for the halting problem *H*(*M*, *w*) for any machine *M* and input *w*. Since we know that such an *S* cannot exist, it follows that the language *E* is also undecidable.

## Web application(Web 应用程序)[1]

> The general distinction between a [dynamic web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page) of any kind and a "web application" is unclear. Web sites most likely to be referred to as "web applications" are those which have similar functionality to a desktop software application, or to a [mobile app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app). [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) introduced explicit language support for making applications that are loaded as web pages, but can store data locally and continue to function while offline.
>
>  are more application-like because they reject the more typical web paradigm of moving between distinct pages with different [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL). Single-page frameworks might be used to speed development of such a web app for a mobile platform.
>
> Mobile web application
>
> Further information: 
>
> There are several ways of targeting mobile devices when making a web application:
>
> + Responsive web design can be used to make a web application - whether a conventional website or a single-page application viewable on small screens that works well with touchscreens.
> - Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline and device hardware access traditionally available only to native mobile applications.
> - [Native apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_app) or "mobile apps" run directly on a mobile device, just as a conventional software application runs directly on a desktop computer, without a web browser (and potentially without the need for Internet connectivity); these are typically written in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) (for [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) devices) or [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) or [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) (for [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) devices). Recently, frameworks allow the development of native apps for all platforms using languages other than each standard native language.
> - Hybrid apps embed a web site inside a native app, possibly using a hybrid framework. This allows development using web technologies (and possibly directly copying code from an existing mobile web site) while also retaining certain advantages of native apps (e.g. direct access to device hardware, offline operation, app store visibility). Hybrid app frameworks include [Apache Cordova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova), [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)), [Haxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haxe), [React Native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_Native) and [Xamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin).
