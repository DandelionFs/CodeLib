## PREFACE

> "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."   --Linus Torvalds 

This is a self-using code lib, which displays data(knowledge) and mind I've seen or used towards coding. I wanna use it lightly everywhere I worked(so other name called blog! \^ _ \^ ). Forgiving me who had used half-angle punctuation in every docs, cause shiefing Chinese and English again and again made my mind in a mess.(-_-)

So, Here we go !!!

## EXPERIENCE
- Always write `#` is a good habits, which could play roles in searching function.
- Don't use phone in a long time once, especially maintain 5 mins/once 5 hours/day, cause phone would waste much of time in interaction. In most cases, button is enough and effcient.
- Things using heart would be effcient. Such as I put my heart in writting and creating, thus that would be interactive friendly, which is clear in limitation of each thing and ecouraging me to do better than the moment now.
